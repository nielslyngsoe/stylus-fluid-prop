#### Description:

FluidProp can be used to define a property value with one or several linear interpolations controlled by the viewport width.


#### Example:

```html {
   
   FluidProp-start('font-size', 320, 7);
   FluidProp-step(1024, 10);
   FluidProp-step(1600, 12);
   FluidProp-end();
   
}
```

This will result in the font-size begin 7px when the viewport-width is between 0px and 320px.
Between 320px and 1024px the font-size will grow linear from 7px to 10px.
As well the font-size will grow from 10px to 12px from viewport-width 1024px to 1600px.
When the users viewport-width has reached 1600px the font-size will stay at 12px.


#### Example with endless growth:

```html {
   
   FluidProp-start('font-size', 320, 7);
   FluidProp-step(1024, 10);
   FluidProp-step(1600, 12);
   FluidProp-endless(.05);
   
}
```

In this example the font-size will growth endlessly from a viewport width of 1600px and up.
From 1600px the font-size will grow with 4% of the viewport width growth, meaning that at a viewport of 1700px the font-size will be 17px (cause 4% of 100px is 4px).
